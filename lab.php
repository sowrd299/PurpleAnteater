                <h1>About the Lab</h1>
                <br/><br/>The Game Lab is a space graciously given to VGDC by UCI to help provide a place in which members and non-members alike can come together to collaborate on projects, ask each other for help, or even just hang out and do some homework! It is also the major central hub for many club activities, such as officer-led workshops, VGDC-run Game Jams, Friday Game Nights, and always remains a friendly, open space!

                <h1>Location and Times</h1>
                <br/><br/>Located in the lobby of Donald Bren Hall (DBH) in room 1412, the Game Lab is open at regular hours (10:00 AM - 7:00 PM) throughout the week to provide a space at which creative, game-developer minds can gather. If you need help from a specific department, please check the schedule on the left to see when they're available in the Lab!
